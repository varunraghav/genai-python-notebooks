# genai-python-notebooks
Python Projects that utilize LLM's

## Folders Included

- **UsingOpenaiAPI:** Introduction to OpenAI functionality. I have done 2 projects to demonstrate basic GenAI capabilities in this folder. For the 1st project, I used basic webscrapping to scrape websites, get information, and utilize OpenAI API to create brochures. For the 2nd project, I inputted a mock Flight price data and created a chatbox based on it.
- **RAG_Demonstration:** I uploaded a book and trained a RAG on top of it to achieve accurate information and prevent model hallucination.
